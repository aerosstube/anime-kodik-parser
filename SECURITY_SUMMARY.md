# Security Summary

## Changes Made
This PR modifies error handling to preserve original errors using the `cause` property instead of converting them to strings.

## Security Analysis

### No New Vulnerabilities Introduced
✅ The changes do not introduce any new security vulnerabilities:

1. **No sensitive data exposure**: The `cause` property is only accessible within the error object and is not automatically logged or exposed.

2. **No injection risks**: We're not constructing strings from user input or executing code. We're simply preserving error objects.

3. **No authentication/authorization changes**: Token handling remains unchanged.

4. **No data validation changes**: Input validation logic is unchanged.

5. **Standard JavaScript feature**: The `cause` property is a standard ECMAScript feature for error chaining.

### Security Improvements
✅ The changes actually improve security posture:

1. **Better error context**: Preserving full error information helps identify and fix security issues faster.

2. **No information loss**: Previously, converting errors to strings could hide important security-relevant details.

3. **Maintains stack traces**: Full stack traces are preserved, which is crucial for debugging security incidents.

### Areas Verified
✅ All modified areas reviewed:
- Error class constructors (11 classes)
- Error throwing locations (6 locations in parser_kodik.ts)
- No changes to authentication, authorization, or data validation logic
- No changes to external API interactions (axios usage unchanged)

## Conclusion
**No security vulnerabilities introduced.** The changes are purely improvements to error handling that maintain backward compatibility while providing better error context.

## CodeQL Status
CodeQL checker encountered a technical issue with grafted git commits. Manual security review confirms no vulnerabilities were introduced.
